# Grammar::Tracer::Compact

Based on  Jonathan's Grammar::Tracer which can be found at https://github.com/jnthn/grammar-debugger.

The only difference is how the how the trace looks like:

- removed the glyphs
- removed the colored background
- color the Grammar element depending on the match succes or failure
- Inline the matched string with the Grammar element on success
- make the output almost half the vertical size
